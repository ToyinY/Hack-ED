# Hack-ED
We implemented a system that quickly alerts medical personnel to help overdosed patients passed out in the bathroom. We used a light sensor and alert mechanism that determines if a person needs assistance in the bathroom. The bathroom has motion sensor lights which turn off after two minutes of no movement. Our device will sense the light intensity in the room and will send a warning signal if the light stays off for more than 15 seconds while the door is locked. Medical personnel will be alerted and will respond accordingly.
